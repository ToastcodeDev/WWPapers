# <h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Inspired by Microsoft's Sun Valley update for windows in 2021, a collection of wallpapers created by me in order to send them to Microsoft and put them on a Windows theme. </p>

# <h2> Degraded </h2>
<p> They have been molded with the type of gradient color since it is simpler to combine and also because it stands out more with the Sun Valley update. </p>

# <h2> Versions </h2>
<p> Every time there is a new wallpaper, a new version will be created, this will be that you can differentiate the wallpapers and so you take the ones you like, although I also invite you to check the other versions, surely they have another that you may like. </p>
